### Code Smell Refactors

This repository lists some code smells, and it will explain how to refactor them away and why.

The files are named in sequence according to how easy the smells are to resolve:

    <sequencePosition>Smell.ts

and the corresponding refactor:

    <sequencePosition>Refactor.ts

Clone this repo and see if you can identify what code smell is being demonstrated.
Before looking at the code, take a moment to analyse it and then make a note.
Look at the corresponding refactoring file showing the refactor outcome and see if your guess was correct.
