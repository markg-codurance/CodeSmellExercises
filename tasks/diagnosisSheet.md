##Your Diagnosis

###Instructions

<u>Do this exercise as individuals and don't share your findings with anyone yet.</u>

Take 20 minutes to analyse the given piece of code to understand it and see what code smells can you identify? 

When you analyse the code try to imagine you were the person writing it originally, so you can think *why* 
certain choices may have been made.

Remember a code smell is an indication that something might be sub-optimally
designed, not that there is necessarily a better way of writing the code.

Start off by making a bullet point list naming the code smells you identify. Then look deeper to see if 

###Investigate and Strategise

1. Where in the code do you see the code smells?
2. What object calisthenics principles are violated?
3. What cohesion and coupling violations can you see?
4. Does the language fit the objectives of the code?
5. List some refactorings you might make?
6. Think about the transformations you need to make?
7. What tests might you need to add?
8. What steps can you foresee you could take to remedy the situation?


**Can you formulate a refactoring/transformation strategy to effect change?**
